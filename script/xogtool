=head1 NAME

xogtool - Frontend tool to Clarity::XOG::Merge

=head1 ABOUT

This is a Clarity XOG tool. Its primary usecase is merging I<XOG>
project files. See C<xogtool help merge> for more details.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 merge

This provides the core functionality of the tool.

 xogtool merge [-dfiov] [long options...]

Merge Clarity project files.

You either specify the files to merge or it finds all C<*.xml> files
either in local directory or the directory you specified with B<-i>.

Specify an output file with B<-o>, default is C<XOGMERGE.xml> in
current directory. If you want to force overwrite an existing output
file without asking then specify B<-f>.

During the process a temporary directory is created, used, and cleaned
up at the end.

To self-test the xogtool use the C<xogtool selftest>.

Options:

=over 4

=item -o|--out <FILENAME>

Write result to that file

=item -i|--in <SUBDIR>

Search default input files in that subdir

=item -v|--verbose

Be verbose

=item -d|--debug

Output debugging info

=item -f|--force

Force overwrite of existing output file.

=back

=head2 selftest

 xogtool selftest 

Built-in self test.

Merge some self-contained dummy xml files into a temporary result file
and executes plausibility checks.

This is to check for general working, like XML parsing, create and
cleanup temp files, etc.

Expected output is some 'ok' lines and number of tests, eg. '1..4'.

  commands: list the application's commands
      help: display a command's help screen
